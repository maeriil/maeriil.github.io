# What to expect from this site?

I wanted to start publishing all my features that I have created in order to make myself more marketable. I have realized that I haven't really showcased all the things I can do in ROBLOX. I want to pursue game development full time and creating games solo has proven to be quite difficult. Which is why I think having a good portfolio will help me find some collaborators to team up with.

I also want to post some of the blogs about data oriented designs and ECS. These are two principles i use a lot daily; Almost all of my projects will be using ECS as thats what I feel the most comfortable using. So I will create few blogs about how I use them, or if I found any interesting usecase for it and so on.

Lastly, I might just create random posts too, who knows. I don't really want to make the website too rigid after all. But let's see how it goes.
